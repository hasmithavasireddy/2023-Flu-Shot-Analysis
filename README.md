# 2022 Flu Shot Analysis with Dashboards

## Overview
The 2022 Flu Shot Analysis project leverages a comprehensive healthcare dataset to explore a wide array of analytical queries. These queries span various aspects crucial for public health officials, healthcare providers, and policy-makers. The project aims to harness the power of SQL for data querying and Tableau for insightful visualizations, thus equipping stakeholders with actionable insights into immunization trends, healthcare resource utilization, and financial aspects of patient care.

## Tableau Visualizations
- **Dashboard:** A visual compilation of demographic statistics and flu shot data.
Flu Shots by Age: This seems to be a horizontal bar chart that illustrates the percentage of flu shots administered within different age ranges.

Flu Shots by Race: This is likely a stacked bar chart showcasing the percentage of flu shots given across different racial groups.

Flu Shot by % by County: Displayed on a map, this visualization indicates the percentage of flu shots administered across various counties.

Total Flu Shots: A numerical visualization or KPI (Key Performance Indicator) that provides the total count of flu shots administered.

Running Sum of Flu Shots 2022: A line or area chart that demonstrates the cumulative number of flu shots administered over time in 2022.

Flu Shot List: This is a list or table that enumerates individuals along with the number of flu shots they've received, possibly highlighting the most and least frequent recipients.

## Analytical Queries
### Demographic Breakdown of Flu Vaccinations
- **Age, Race, and Location Specific Data (2022):** Number of flu vaccinations administered categorized by patients' age, race, and residential county.

### Vaccination Rates Analysis
- **Stratified Vaccination Rates (2022):** Comparative analysis of flu shot reception rates, segmented by various demographics such as age, race, and county.
- **Aggregate Vaccination Rate (2022):** The comprehensive percentage of patients who received the flu shot across healthcare institutions.

### Time Series Analysis of Vaccine Administration
- **Monthly Flu Shot Distribution (2022):** A monthly breakdown of flu shot administration throughout the year.

### Overall Vaccination Efforts
- **Total Vaccinations (2022):** The cumulative count of flu shots delivered over the year.

### Lists of Patients Based on Vaccination Status
- **Vaccinated Patient Roster (2022):** A registry of patients who received the flu shot.
- **Unvaccinated Patient Roster (2022):** A catalog of patients who did not receive the flu shot.

### Extended Analytical Questions
- **Patient Demographic Composition:** Distribution of patients across predefined age brackets.
- **Top Cities by Patient Volume:** The five cities with the largest patient populations.
- **Average Patient Encounters:** Calculation of the mean number of healthcare encounters per patient.
- **Condition Frequency Analysis:** Identification of the ten most prevalent health conditions.
- **Healthcare Spending Insights:** Determination of the average healthcare expenditure per patient.
- **Encounter Category Analysis:** The most frequently occurring types of patient encounters.
- **Financial Analysis - Income and Coverage Correlation:** Exploration of the relationship between patient income levels and their healthcare coverage.
- **Vaccination Type Distribution:** Enumeration of patients by the variety of immunizations received.
- **Life Expectancy Differentials:** Average patient age at the time of death, with stratification by gender and race.
- **Provider Activity Levels:** Identification of the healthcare provider with the highest patient encounter count.
- **Analysis of Encounter-Related Finances:** Average claim costs and payer contributions across different encounter categories.
- **Marital Status vs. Health Service Use:** Comparison of healthcare encounters between married and single patients.
- **Ethnic Disparities in Healthcare Spending:** Analysis of healthcare costs across different racial and ethnic groups.
- **Chronic Illness and Healthcare Engagement:** Patients with chronic conditions ranked by their frequency of healthcare encounters.
- **Patient Financial Vulnerability Assessment:** Pinpointing patients with significant healthcare spending who lack adequate coverage.

This collection of inquiries forms the foundation of the 2022 Flu Shot Analysis project, aiming to illuminate the interplay between patient demographics, healthcare service usage, and the financial dynamics of healthcare delivery.
